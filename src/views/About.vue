    <h1>Wonder Runs In Our Veins</h1>
    <p>
      My Great Grandfather owned a toy shop, his sole purpose in life was to bring joy to others. Unfortunately, he was
      also a terrible businessman. He would drive to the next city over and buy all the toys from another store, and
      then sell them for barely over retail price at his own location. We intend to continue his tradition of bringing
      joy by any means possible. Here at Nicholson Emporium, we garuntee Wonder, in every box.
